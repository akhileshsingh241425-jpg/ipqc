# Run this command from your backend directory to apply the new table:

alembic upgrade head

# If you have not initialized Alembic, first run:
# alembic init migrations
# Then add your models and run:
# alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add whatsapp_alert_log table"
# Then run:
# alembic upgrade head

# If you use Flask-Migrate, use:
# flask db migrate -m "add whatsapp_alert_log table"
# flask db upgrade
